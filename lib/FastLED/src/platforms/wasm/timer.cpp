// ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING: C++ ‚Üî JavaScript TIMING BRIDGE - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
//
// üö® THIS FILE CONTAINS C++ TO JAVASCRIPT TIMING BINDINGS üö®
//
// DO NOT MODIFY FUNCTION SIGNATURES WITHOUT UPDATING CORRESPONDING JAVASCRIPT CODE!
//
// This file provides critical timing functions for WASM builds. Any changes to:
// - EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE timing function signatures
// - millis(), micros(), delay(), delayMicroseconds(), yield() signatures
// - Return types or parameters
// - Function names
//
// Will BREAK JavaScript timing operations and cause SILENT RUNTIME FAILURES!
//
// Key integration points that MUST remain synchronized:
// - extern "C" uint32_t millis()
// - extern "C" uint32_t micros()
// - extern "C" void delay(int ms)
// - extern "C" void delayMicroseconds(int micros)
// - extern "C" void yield()
// - JavaScript Module.cwrap() calls for timing functions
//
// Before making ANY changes:
// 1. Understand this affects ALL timing-dependent animations and sketches
// 2. Test with real WASM builds that use delays and timing
// 3. Verify timing accuracy remains consistent
// 4. Check that animations still run at correct speeds
//
// ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: Timing errors break ALL animations and effects! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
